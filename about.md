Started as a freelance programmer when I was just 15, I’ve quickly grown to a highly qualified and valued developer at Eleks Software where I worked with some of the world-famous companies and products. Soon I’ve become a team leader and a project manager of a Chicago-based real-estate management project. I have diverse and highly rated professional skills in variety of informational technologies as well as interests in other areas like cosmology and neuro-electronics. 

In 2010 I founded my first startup **Kartinka** – an online in-image advertising network which brought together online media publishers and advertisers in a unique revolutionary way. 

Later in 2014 I assembled a distributed outsourcing team known as **Synnergia Solutions** Agency to work on multiple commercial projects as well as on our own ideas. We had a number of multi-million- and billion-dollar companies amongst our clients. 

In 2016 I founded another company **drop2amz** – an Amazon analytics and drop-shipping automation platform allowing thousands of sellers worldwide to conduct a profitable business on Amazon. 

In 2018 I started working on my next company **Scrape AI** – a SaaS leveraging AI and deep-learning technologies for large-scale online data scraping and structuring.

For the 2019/2020 term I am doing my **Masters in Data Science at UBC** - really excited about it, and looking forward to start applying new knowledge for my projects!
